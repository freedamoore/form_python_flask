## Using python and Flask for running local server and form handling

A very basic form that uses python and flask to handle data.

Submits data to a csv file using the write_to_csv function (change to use write_to_file function if you prefer txt file)

After installing Flask, I use git bash and run the following commands after navigating to the project folder

* export FLASK_APP=server.py
* export FLASK_ENV=development
* flask run
